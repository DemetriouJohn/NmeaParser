# NmeaParser

![.NET Core Build and Run Unit Tests](https://github.com/DevsAnon/NmeaParser/workflows/.NET%20Core%20Build%20and%20Run%20Unit%20Tests/badge.svg?event=push)


This is a .Net Standard NMEA protocol parser. The goal is to support the standard protocol and slowly introduce custom arbitrary NMEA lines from different providers.
This will soon be a nuget package for everyone to download directly into their projects.
